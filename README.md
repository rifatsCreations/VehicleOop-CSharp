# 🚗 VehicleOop – Console App Using OOP in C#

This is a console-based C# application built to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by simulating different types of vehicles like **Car** and **Motorcycle**.

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- Create multiple vehicles (Car / Motorcycle)
- Accepts dynamic user input from console
- Displays detailed information per vehicle
- Demonstrates OOP pillars with real-world examples
- Handles invalid input using exceptions

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Class & Object** → `Car`, `MotorCycle`, `Vehicle`
- **Inheritance** → Car and MotorCycle inherit from Vehicle
- **Encapsulation** → Properties with access control
- **Abstraction** → Shared behavior via methods like `GetDetails()`
- **Enum** → `VehicleType` used to classify vehicle purpose
